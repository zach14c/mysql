# This test checks how online backup handles object names encoded using 
# extended character sets (non-latin1)
#
# 1) Test that table whose name uses extended character set is backed up and
#    retored correctly.
#
# 2) Test that above holds also when user changes the default character sets
#    using SET NAMES command or if these settings are different during backup
#    and restore time.
#
# TODO:
#
# - Test more character sets.
# - Test that native backup engines are not confuced by extended charsets.
# - Test that all meta-data stored in backup image is always handled correctly
#   regardless of character set settings on backup and restore servers.
