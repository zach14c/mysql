# This test script tests the behaviour reported in BUG#34721
#
# Test uses error injection activated with 'backup_test_dummy_be_factory' keyword.
# The code is injected into has_native_backup() function in backup_info.cc.
# When activated, it overwrites the native MyISAM backup factory with a dummy one 
# which never creates an engine. This change is permanent and can not be reversed by 
# disabling the error injection code. The only way to restore the original situation 
# is by restarting the server. Therefore:
#
# 1. This test should have .opt file so that a separate server instance is run for 
# it.
#
# 2. The order of operations in the test is relevant: we must first check the 
# standard behaviour and only then activate the injected debug code.
