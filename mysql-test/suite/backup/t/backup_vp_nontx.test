#
# This test is one of two validity point tests. See:
#    backup_vp_tx.test
#
# The goal of the test should be to ensure the following assumptions
# for the behavior of validity point (VP) hold. Validity point is
# implemented using commit blocker (CB).
#
# Note: in this file, "DML" refers to DML operations executed in
#       non-transactional storage engines.
#
# a) DMLs that are executed before VP are in the backup image
#
# b) setting the validity point should not be done while DMLs are
#    being processed in any table involved in the backup. An active
#    DML therefore blocks backup from setting commit blocker. The DML
#    has to complete before backup can set CB (and ultimately set the
#    VP), and will therefore be in the backup image
#
# c) setting the validity point should not be done while DMLs are
#    being processed in any table involved in the backup. A DML
#    operation requested when backup is ready to set VP is therefore
#    blocked by CB. The DML has to wait for CB to be released before
#    it can continue, and will therefore not be in the backup image
#
# d) DMLs executed after VP are not in the backup image
