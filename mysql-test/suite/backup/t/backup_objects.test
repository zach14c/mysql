#
# This test is testing backup and restore of database objects.
#
# The following objects are tested:
# - tables
# - views
# - stored procedures and functions
# - triggers
# - events
#
# It is also tested that backup and restore works correctly when there are
# dependencies between objects such as:
# - one table depends on another table via foreign key constraint,
# - a view depends on a table or another view,
# - stored routine or event refers to another object.

--source include/have_innodb.inc
--source include/not_embedded.inc

# Note: BACKUP crashes server when InnoDB engine is used and views are 
# included in the image (see BUG#34758). Until this issue is resolved we 
# can't use InnoDB engine here and thus define table dependencies using 
# foreign key constraints.
#
# If tables use MyISAM storage engine the test works but all foreign
# key constraints are silently ignored. When BUG#34758 is fixed, the line 
# below should be changed to make InnoDB the default storage engine so that
# handling of dependencies introduced by foreign keys can also be tested.
#
# Note that there is a separate test backup_fkey testing foreign key
# constraints.

# Create views with non-trivial dependencies. 
#
# Notes:
#
# - It is important that each database contains a view which depends on a view from the
#   other one. Thanks to that the correct order of restoring these views is non-trivial
#   and mixes views from different databases. If, for example, we would first create 
#   views from one database and then from the other one we would always get a failure 
#   regardless of the order in which databases are processed.
#
# - Views use the function defined above to check that this is handled correctly.
